# Exercise-02d-Menu-HUD-Levels
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 15 February 2021

This exercise is designed to explore changing scenes and control nodes. I am hoping this gives you what you need to complete your project.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-02d-Menu-HUD-Levels. *Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-S21 with your full name.* Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Clone the repository to a Local Path on your computer.

Open Godot. In the Project Manager, tap the "Import" button. Tap "Browse" and navigate to the repository folder. Select the project.godot file and tap "Open".

In the viewport, you should see a *very* rough 2D space shooter-style game. The A and D controls move the ship left and right, and the space button will shoot a laser at the space cows.

Your assignment for this exercise is to provide the following: change the default scene to a main menu that offers options to Play and Quit. The play button should load the Game.tscn scene. Add an AutoLoad HUD scene that displays score and health as labels. When the score reaches 100, the scene should change to level2.tscn (which you will need to create). level2.tscn is identical to game.tscn, except the cows are replaced by narwhals. Add an end-game screen that appears when the player's health reaches zero.

You can change to a new scene in Godot with a simple statement:
```
get_tree().change_scene("res://path/to/scene.tscn")
```

If you are experiencing performance issues, replace the background node with a Sprite (named background). load nebula.jpg as the texture for the sprite, and position it at 0,0.

The instructions are as follows:

## HUD
 * Right-click on the Game node and Add Child Node. Select Control. Rename the new Control node "HUD".
 * Right-click on the HUD node and Add Child Node. Select ColorRect. In the Inspector panel, Select Control->Rect->Size. Set it to x=1024, y=40. Select ColorRect->Color. Set A=64
 * Right-click on the HUD node and Add Child Node. Select Label. Rename the new Label node "Health". In the Inspector panel, select Control->Margin and set Left=10. select select Control->Rect->Size. Set it to x=502, y=40. Select Label->Text. Set it to "Health: ". Set Valign=Center. Select Control->Custom Fonts->Font->New Dynamic Font. Select Font again, and select Edit. In the DynamicFont menu that appears, Select Font->FontData and choose Load. Open res://Assets/BebasNeueRegular.otf/. Select DynamicFont->Settings and set Size=20.
 * Right-click on the Health node and Duplicate. Rename the Health2 node "Score". In the Inspector panel, set Label->Text to "Score: ". Set Label->Align=Right. In  Control->Rect set Position.x=512
 * Choose the Script Workspace, and select File->New Script. Name the script Global.gd. Replace the contents of that script (make sure you use tabs to indent it) with:

```
extends Node

var score = 0
var health = 100
var level = 0

func _process(delta):
	if Input.is_action_pressed("quit"):	
		get_tree().quit()
```
 * Save the script.

 * In Project Settings, select the AutoLoad tab. In the path field, select res://Global.gd. The Node Name should be Global. Press Add.
 * Right-click on the HUD node and Attach Script. Press the file icon next to Path. Create a new Folder: HUD. Save the new script to res://HUD/HUD.gd. Replace the contents of that script with:
 
```
extends Control

onready var global = get_node("/root/Global")

func _ready():
	update_score(0)
	update_health(0)


func update_score(s):
	global.score += s
	$Score.text = "Score: " + str(global.score)
	if global.score >= 100 and global.level != 2:
		global.level = 2
		get_tree().change_scene("res://Level/Level2.tscn")

func update_health(h):
	global.health += h
	$Health.text = "Health: " + str(global.health)
	if global.health <= 0:
		get_tree().change_scene("res://Menu/Die.tscn")

 ```

## Changing levels and Level 2

* In the Scene menu, select Save Scene As…. Save it as res://Level/Level2.tscn
* Change the name of the Cow node to Narwhal. Select it, and drag Assets/narwhal.wav from the FileSystem panel to the Stream property in the Inspector panel.
* Next to the Enemies node, click on the script icon. Viewing Enemies.gd in the Script Workspace, File->Save As… res://Enemies/Enemies2.gd
* Change line 3 of Enemies2.gd to: `onready var Enemy = load("res://Enemy/Enemy2.tscn")
* In the Scene menu, Open Scene. Open res://Enemy/Enemy.tscn
* Open the Enemy.gd script. Replace the contents of the script with the following:

```
extends KinematicBody2D

export var speed = Vector2(0,3)
export var health = 100
export var points = 10
export var damage = 50

onready var Explosion = load("res://Explosion/Explosion.tscn")
onready var Sound = get_node("/root/Game/Narwhal")


func _physics_process(delta):
	position += speed

	if position.y > get_viewport().size.y + 100:
		queue_free()

func die():
	HUD.update_score(points)
	var explosion = Explosion.instance()
	explosion.position = position
	get_node("/root/Game/Explosions").add_child(explosion)
	explosion.get_node("Animation").play()
	Sound.play()
	queue_free()
```
* Again, in the Scene menu, Save Scene As… res://Enemy/Enemy2.tscn
* Right click on the cow node and select Delete Node(s). Also, delete the CollisionPolygon2D.
* Drag the narwhal.png image out of the Assets folder into the Workspace. In the Inspector panel, Node2D->Transform->Position set both x and y = 0
* In the toolbar, select Sprite->Create CollisionPolygon2D Sibling
* Save the scene

## Main menu

 * In the Scene menu, select New Scene. In the Scene panel, Create Root Node: select User Interface. Change the name of the Control node to "Menu"
 * Right-click on the Menu node and Add Child Node. Select Label. In the Inspector Panel, set the Label->Text="Welcome!". Label->Align=Center, Label->Valign=Center. Control->Rect->Size x=1024, y=300.  Select Control->Custom Fonts->Font->New Dynamic Font. Select Font again, and select Edit. In the DynamicFont menu that appears, Select Font->FontData and choose Load. Open res://Assets/BebasNeueRegular.otf/. Select DynamicFont->Settings and set Size=60.
 * Right-click on the Menu node and Add Child Node. Select Button. Change the name of the node to "Play". In the Inspector Panel, set the Button->Text="Play". Control->Rect->Position x=412, y=300. Control->Rect->Size x=200, y=60.  Select Control->Custom Fonts->Font->New Dynamic Font. Select Font again, and select Edit. In the DynamicFont menu that appears, Select Font->FontData and choose Load. Open res://Assets/BebasNeueRegular.otf/. Select DynamicFont->Settings and set Size=24.
 * Right-click on the Play node and Duplicate. Change the name of the Play2 node to "Quit". In the Inspector Panel, set the Label->Text="Quit". Control->Rect->Position y=380.
 * Right-click on the Menu node and Attach Script. Create a new Menu folder, and save the script as res://Menu/Menu.gd
 * Select the Play node and open the Node panel. Double-click on the pressed() signal and attach it to the Menu script
 * Select the Quit node and open the Node panel. Double-click on the pressed() signal and attach it to the Menu script
 * Replace the contents of Menu.gd with the following:

```
extends Control

func _on_Play_pressed():
   get_tree().change_scene("res://Game.tscn")

func _on_Quit_pressed():
  get_tree().quit()
```

 * Save the scene as res://Menu/Menu.tscn
 * Open the Project Settings. In General->Appliction->Run, set the main scene as res://Menu/Menu.tscn

## End-game screen

 * In the Scene menu, select New Scene. In the Scene panel, Create Root Node: select User Interface. Change the name of the Control node to "Menu"
 * Right-click on the Menu node and Add Child Node. Select Label. In the Inspector Panel, set the Label->Text="You Died!". Label->Align=Center, Label->Valign=Center. Control->Rect->Size x=1024, y=300.  Select Control->Custom Fonts->Font->New Dynamic Font. Select Font again, and select Edit. In the DynamicFont menu that appears, Select Font->FontData and choose Load. Open res://Assets/BebasNeueRegular.otf/. Select DynamicFont->Settings and set Size=60.
 * Right-click on the Menu node and Add Child Node. Select Button. Change the name of the node to "Play". In the Inspector Panel, set the Button->Text="Play Again?". Control->Rect->Position x=412, y=300. Control->Rect->Size x=200, y=60.  Select Control->Custom Fonts->Font->New Dynamic Font. Select Font again, and select Edit. In the DynamicFont menu that appears, Select Font->FontData and choose Load. Open res://Assets/BebasNeueRegular.otf/. Select DynamicFont->Settings and set Size=24.

 * Right-click on the Menu node and Attach Script. Create a new Menu folder, and save the script as res://Menu/Die.gd
 * Select the Play node and open the Node panel. Double-click on the pressed() signal and attach it to the Menu script
 * Select the Quit node and open the Node panel. Double-click on the pressed() signal and attach it to the Menu script
 * Replace the contents of Menu.gd with the following:

```
extends Control

onready var global = get_node("/root/Global")

func _on_Play_pressed():
	global.score = 0
	global.health = 100
	global.level = 1
	get_tree().change_scene("res://Game.tscn")

func _on_Quit_pressed():
	get_tree().quit()
```

 * Save the scene as res://Menu/Die.tscn
 * We are almost done. Open the Player.gd script. Replace the contents of the script with the following:
 ```
extends KinematicBody2D

onready var HUD = get_node("/root/Game/HUD")
export var speed = 7


func _physics_process(delta):
	position += get_input()*speed
	if Input.is_action_pressed("shoot") and not $Laser.is_casting:
		$Laser.fire(Vector2(global_position.x, 0))
	elif not Input.is_action_pressed("shoot") and $Laser.is_casting:
		$Laser.stop()
	


func get_input():
	var input_dir = Vector2(0,0)
	if Input.is_action_pressed("left"):
		input_dir.x -= 1
	if Input.is_action_pressed("right"):
		input_dir.x += 1
	return input_dir.rotated(rotation)


func _on_Damage_body_entered(body):
	HUD.update_health(-body.damage)
	body.die()
 ```

 * Now open Enemy.gd. After the extends statement (line 3), add
 ```
 onready var HUD = get_node("/root/Game/HUD")
 ```
 * and then as the first line of the die() function (now-line 21), add
 ```
 HUD.update_score(points)
 ```
 (making sure you have indented appropriately.
 
 * Make the same two changes to Enemy2.gd.

Test the game. You should be able to start the game, go to the second level, and then see the end-game screen when the health goes to zero.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, you should now see the updated files listed in the left panel. In the bottom of that panel, type a Summary message (something like "Completes the game development") and press the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-02d-Menu-HUD-Levels) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
```
